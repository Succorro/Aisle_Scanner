# Aisle Scanner

The Aisle Scanner app is a mobile application developed using Expo's React Native tools. This app allows users to scan barcodes of products and dynamically create a layout of the scanned items in real time.

## Installation

To install and run the Scanning App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Succorro/Aisle_Scanner.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Aisle_Scanner
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start Expo Server**:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Expo server and open the Expo DevTools in your default web browser.

5. **Run on Simulator or Device**:
   - Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device.
   - Alternatively, press `i` to run the app on an iOS simulator or `a` to run it on an Android emulator.

## Usage

Once the app is running on your device or simulator:

1. **Scan Barcodes**: Use the barcode scanner to scan the barcodes of products.
2. **Real-Time Layout**: As you scan each barcode, the app dynamically updates the layout to display the scanned items.
3. **View Product Details**: Tap on a scanned item to view more details about the product.
